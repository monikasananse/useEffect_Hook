useEffect:
useEffect hook allows us to perform side effect in your functional components
some example of side effect that is fetching data ,direct updating dom, and timer.

useEffect hook accepts two arguments first is function and second is dependecy.second one is optional.
useEffect runs on every render that means that when the count changes in the count a render happens which triggers another effect.

there are several ways to control side effect in useEffect.for these we include the second parameter which accepts and array.we 
cann optionally pass dependecy to useEffect in this array.

1:-No dependecy
useEffect(()=>{
    //runs on every render.
})
2:- An empty array
 useEffect(()=>{
    //run only on first render.
 },[])
3:-props ands state value:
 useEffect(()=>{
    //runs on first render
    //any time any dependecy value change.
 }[props,state])
